## List of Tasks for the next session.

1. We shall learn the usage of C++ STL Algorithms and data structures.
2. We need to conform to ACM-ICPC style problem solving.
3. We shall learn to commit and push to github.
4. We read the previous session slides and code reference if any and try to implement in language of our choice.
5. Detailed tasks mentioned in ```task.md``` file in ```sessions``` folder. 

## Introductory Session

1. We learnt about an algorithm approach to problrm solving. The flavour of what algorithms do in general.
2. Simple problem solving approach. 
3. Took a simple graph theory problem and learn't about an algorithmic approach to problem solving.
